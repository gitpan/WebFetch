WebFetch To-Do List
$Revision: 1.2 $
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* add docs for each WebFetch-derived module explaining better how to call
  it from within Perl.  (Current docs emphasize the command line because
  that's how it's been used.  But it isn't the only way to use it.)
* finish WebFetch::General module (exports to the format are done but we
  need to module to read them)
* modify WebFetch::SiteNews so that it's more generalized (instead of
  SVLUG-specific) and document the file format in the POD docs.
* add more fetch modules:
  * ARRL W1AW bulletins
  * California State OES bulletins
  * others as submitted by users
